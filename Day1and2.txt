Python Software--Open source

way 1:
www.python.org/downloads

any Python IDE's--IDLE/spyder/jupyter notebook/pycharm/eclipse/visualstudio  +python plug ins

way 2:

Anaconda Distribution--python+spyder+jupyter+Machine learning libaries

Python Software + IDE's---->Work on it

Python+IDLE
Python+Pycharm

Python
What is Python ??? is the Programming Language
Python is General purpose Programming Language
Python is High Level Programming Language
Python is Procedural/Functional Programming Language
Python is OOPS Programming Language

Software(Applications)(APPS)<---------------->Programming Language

High end Rich technology

Computer---Desktop/Laptop/Tab/Smart phones
-----Hardware's
-----OS--software---Application Software
Multitasking----installing Software

Software are developed  with the help of programming languages.

Python is Programming Language
Python is General purpose Programming Language
----->GUI /Desktop Applications
----->Web Designing and Web Application
----->Gaming Devlopment
----->System Admin work
----->Complex financial calculations
----->Data science
------>Scientific Applications and much more...........

Python is High Level Programming Language---English

Low level Prog Lang---machine 0101000011110/Symbolic code
High level Prog Lang--English

----Compiler-
Source  code(.py)----compiler---------machine code(010001111)/Object code(.pyc)

----Library Files----
In C language-----
printf("welcome to c")

In C++ language
cout<<"welcome to c++")

In Java
System.out.println("Welcome to java!!!");

IN Python
print("Welcome to PYTHON!!!")

xyz()---machine /environment will undestand xyz only by referring library files

Python is Procedural/Functional/Modular Programming Language
--Module--breaking down a complex problem into smaller units
in a company--when a project comes----Team of people
-----functions --reuse

step by step procedure/rule-----OOPS

When we want any software
.exe / .msi/ APK files--download and install

C----->program Files--->folder(supporting library files for running the application)

likewise for developing any application using programming language we need supporting
library files

History of Python::: 1991
Guido Van Russam--Netherland based Scientist

Why C language C??
B language/BCPL-----

why it has been named as Python??
Monty Python

python 1.0
python 2.x
Latest Version---Python 3.8.3

Write Once Run Anywhere
Once Python code we can run in any machine(OS)
Open source
Platform Independent
Nowadays Python s inbuilt with Linux/Mac Os
But for Windows we want to download

integer---whole no
floating ---precision point no's

a=1
b=1/2

what is the answer????
in other languages b=0,  but in python answer is 0.5--strong data type support

machine wil take a as integer and b as float

Lets code in Python
1.Interactive Mode
--type in command Prompt--CUI
open-cmd---type python

2.Scripting Mode--program based---use any IDE's ----

i will show both IDLE and Spyder

Exercises:
'''print('Welcome to PYTHON IDLE')
print("Hello All")
print("""Day 1 Demos""")
number1=50
number2=100
print('Addition Answer---',(number1+number2))
print('Addition of %d and %d is %d'%(number1,number2,(number1+number2)))
price=25.70
name='Nivetha'
print('%s bought juice for %.2f price'%(name,price))

#customized output printing
#formatting Printing  %d %f
#single line comment

Multi line commenting
%d ---- integer
%f ---- floating    %c---character(one char)
%s ---- string(group of charaters'''

name1='Abeer'
name2='Anirban'
print('%s and %s are best friends'%(name1,name2))

grade='B'

print('Student %s scored %c grade'%(name2,grade))

********************************************************************************

Mon Tue Thu Fri--Theory class

Wed and Sat --Lab Practice

1.Please download Python/Anaconda Framework

2.Try Interactive Mode through Command Prompt
---python--just check print("hello world")

3.using Spyder or IDLE--Start Lab programs

Try
1.Write a Python  program for simple hello world
2.Write a Python  program for formatted output using
% notation for all 4 data types
3.Addition of two numbers

Start doing, any doubt/issue pls ping me..webinar app
 is having option of taking your machine in remote
 and i can check
